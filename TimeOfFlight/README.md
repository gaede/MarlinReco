# TimeOfFlight

This package deals with computing and displaying time of flight parameters
based on the timing information stored in CalorimeterHits.


## Processors

### TOFPlots

author: N.Weinhold (DESY, internship 2017)

Computes various estimators for the time of flight from CalorimeterHits.
Creates ROOT histograms for these parameters.



### TOFParameters

author F.Gaede, DESY, 2018

Compute various estimators for time of flight and particle velocity.
Add these to the ReconstrucedParticles as PIDParameters
